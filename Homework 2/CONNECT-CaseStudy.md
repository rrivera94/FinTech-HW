## Recommendations

* The general focus as Crossbridge's CONNECT dominate mid-market Assets Under Management has been to focus on fintech to develop easier and more accessible ways to bring clinets via the masses. Its new online platform makes catering your own personal portfolio easier than ever. 
* In terms for recommendations, CONNECT has strayed from its competitors' goal to target high net worth individuals and gives it a unique and lonely conquest in making digital robo-advisment available for all. 
* I search hard for recommendations, however with very little if anything for competitors to show against CONNECT I find my best advice is to remain course. If its not broken, dont try to fix it. My only recommendation is to remain appealing to high-net worth clients.
